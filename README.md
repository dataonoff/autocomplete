# React autocomplete skill test

## Deliverable

A react textarea component that has a Discord-like users and channels autocomplete + formatting

## Specs

- Search for a user and a channel as displayed in the sketch
- Store users and channels badges as `<#{channel_id}>` and `<&{user_id}>` on the underlying textarea value
- Ability to browse options using arrow keys + ability to select an option by pressing on the RETURN key
- Pressing ESC or SPACE should collapse the autocomplete popup
- Surrounding a text by ** and ** should display the text in bold

For any edgecases that aren't visible on the sketch file, please follow the Discord implementation.
